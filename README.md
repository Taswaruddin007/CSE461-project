# Autonomous Farming Robot

This project involved collaboration among a team of 5 members, focusing on the development of an autonomous farming robot. The primary objective of the robot is to enhance agricultural efficiency by performing essential tasks such as seed planting, soil watering, and monitoring soil conditions through moisture and temperature sensors.

The key features of the project include:

1. Soil Monitoring: Utilizing moisture and temperature sensors to assess land conditions.
2. Autonomous Navigation: Employing ultrasonic sensors to detect and navigate around obstacles.
3. Seed Planting: The ability to plant seeds based on real-time moisture levels in the soil.
4. Irrigation Management: Activating watering mechanisms when moisture and temperature conditions are not optimal.

This project provided valuable insights and learning opportunities for all team members involved.
